https://jtuoriniemi.github.io/Cat-vs-Dog-API-website/

This is a simple website project designed for practicing the use of APIs. The website features a playful "Dogs vs Cats" game where you can choose between dogs and cats to see which animal emerges as the champion.

The project uses two separate API calls to fetch random dog and cat images.

Dog images are fetched using one API:       https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

Cat images are fetched using another API:   https://cataas.com/

The project is built using the following technologies:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
